# sentinel_acquisition
automated gathering of sentinel 2 a&b acquisition schedule for the EPSCoR lakes

scripts by B. Steele (steeleb@caryinstitute.org)

workflow: 
- check to see if new files avail -- need to grab file name bits from scratch script and 
- if new files, download and process (this is the bulk of scratch script) -- add source file to these
- move old to archive, process and save file with date
